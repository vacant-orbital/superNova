Instlling superNova:

The superNova package should be added to the MestReNova directory designated to hold your personal scripts 
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Mestrelab Research S.L\MestReNova\scripts  
Where rpotter1 in the path above would be replaced with your JnJ username.  After installing the MestReNova package this file will be empty.  
One needs to obtain the latest version of the pnmr package (pnmr2.0 at the time of creation of this manual) from the administrator as a .zip file.  
The file is then extracted to the path shown above.  One can use different subdirectories to archive different versions of the software if desired.
Befor using the package the three example jobscripts need to chage the scratch directory to one on your computer.  The three example scripts are
named example1.qs, example2.qs and example3.qs. example1.qs and example2.qs have two lines that need to be changed.  These two lines specify where
the temporary integral and composition files will be stored.  For example1 these are lines 10 and 11:

    
    ex1obj.intfilename = "C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\NMR\\text\\example1_int.dat";
    ex1obj.compfilename = "C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\NMR\\text\\example1_comp.dat";

Leave the filenames the same and change the path to point to a new scratch folder that you make on you machine -- NOT THE INSTALL DIRECTORY SHOWN 
AT THE TOP OF THIS DOCUMENT. example3.qs has the same two statements plus a a line within the inset object declaration (line 23) that reads:

    coordsFile : "C:\\Users\\rpotter1\\OneDrive - JNJ\\Documents\\NMR\\text\\example2_coords.dat"  

again, leave the filename the same and point the path toward the scratch directory you made earlier. Two shell scripts are provided to automate 
these edits: setup and setup.ps1 for Linux/Mac and Windows, respectively.
