Welcome to superNova, a small processing package written for MestReNova.  The package contains a collection of scripts that are used to process a group of similar NMR spectra (referred to in notes as a study) in the same fashion.  Install the package according to the notes in INSTALL.txt and edit the 4 example jobscripts as instructed therein.  Two example spectra are provided in the repository for this package.  The D2O spectrum can be processed using one of the following jobscripts: example1.qs, example2.qs, and example2a.qs.  The DMSO spectrum can be processed with example3.qs.  A superNova.pdf manual is provided in the repository that discusses the package and how to alter the code of the above examples to customize and create jobscripts specific to your research needs.  There is also a section at the end which can be used along with the MestReNova API manuals to extend the package however you wish.


Developer Notes:
Due to the nature of NMR processing the package uses mainly a functional programming strategy with the exception of two classes: Pstudy and PspectrumToNormal2dArray.  The first creates a rather large object called a study which contains all the generic function calls that get specified by the jobscripts (example1.qs - example3.qs) at runtime.  The second class is used to create a 2 dimentional array from the NMR spectrum.  This is only done when an inset spectrum of a particular region is requested.  It contains methods that aid in the process of inset spectrum creation.  Due to the size of Pstudy, it makes sense to break up the resposibilities of this class before adding any more capabilities at the moment. That is where the development of this version is focussed as of 05Feb2025.
